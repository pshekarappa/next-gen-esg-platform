invalid type: string "Policy Title Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the Code of Conduct) Policy Owner Human Resources Revision Date January 2023 Effective Date Adopted on June 3, 2014; Effective as of September 1, 2020 Approvers CHRO and General Counsel Xactly Corporation, including each of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, Xactly) is committed to maintaining high standards of ethical, legal and financial integrity, and Xactly takes all complaints and concerns regarding conduct, internal decisions, ethics and other legal matters very seriously. Xactlys business ethics and conduct guides the livelihood of Xactlys employees, contractors, and management and is relied upon by Xactlys investors, customers, employees and business partners. As part of your at-will employment agreement, you agreed to abide by any rules or policies that the company may adopt from time to time, including this Code of Conduct. What is the Code of Conduct? This Code of Conduct is a statement of certain fundamental principles, policies, and procedures that govern the conduct of Xactlys business. Core Values - what we call C.A.R.E - guide our behaviors every day: Customer Focus, Accountability and Integrity, Respect and Excellence in everything we do. These values help us retain a strong cultural identity and are key to our success. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics flows directly from our commitment to our Core Values. While we constantly aim for excellence to provide value for our customers, it is critical we do so with integrity. It is unacceptable to cut legal or ethical corners for the benefit of Xactly or for personal benefit. Our Code of Conduct is designed to deter wrongdoing and promote:  Operating our business with integrity;  Engaging in honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest;  Complying with applicable laws, rules, and regulations;  Promptly reporting of violations of this Code of Conduct; and  Maintaining accountability for following this Code of Conduct. Who Must Follow This Code of Conduct? Our Code of Conduct applies to Xactlys:  Employees  Board members and officers  Independent contractors and consultants 1 Why is the Code of Conduct important? Honest and Ethical Conduct Consistent with our core values, you are expected to act and perform your duties ethically, honestly, and with integrity, based on the idea of doing the right thing even when no one is looking. In furtherance of Xactlys commitment to the highest standards of business ethics and integrity, employees will accurately and honestly represent Xactly and will not engage in any activity or scheme intended to defraud anyone of money, property, or honest services. No employee of Xactly shall make a representation that he or she is acting on behalf of another business, person, entity, or public entity when engaged in business on behalf of Xactly. Misrepresentation by an employee in the course of business is unethical and will not be tolerated. Reported ethical violations of this Code of Conduct will be investigated and appropriate action taken. Avoiding Conflicts of Interest Your decisions and actions when conducting business for Xactly should be based on the best interests of Xactly. You must never use or attempt to use your position with Xactly to obtain improper personal benefits. When you are in a situation in which your personal or professional interests, or those of your friends or family compete with the best interests of Xactly, you may be faced with a conflict of interest. We must avoid conflicts of interest and circumstances that present the appearance of a conflict of interest. Examples of conflicts of interest include:  Serving as a director, employee, contractor/consultant, or advisor to an individual or an entity that has a business relationship with, or is a competitor of Xactly, regardless of whether or not you receive compensation from the individual or entity (defined below in Participation on Boards of Directors and Trustees);  Entering into a business relationship on behalf of Xactly with a friend or relative;  Having a personal investment or financial interest in a competitor, supplier, or customer of Xactly;  Receiving something of value from a competitor, supplier, or customer of Xactly, beyond reasonable entertainment or nominal gifts in the ordinary course of business, such as a meal or coffee mug (defined below in Gifts and Gratuities);  Using Xactlys property, information, relationships, or your position for personal gain; or  Being asked to present at a conference where the conference sponsor has a real or potential business relationship with Xactly, offers travel or accommodation arrangements or other benefits beyond reasonable and customary standards, or business opportunities found through your work at Xactly. Evaluating whether a conflict of interest exists can be difficult and may involve a number of considerations. Please refer to our other policies such as our Travel and Entertainment Expense Policy and Anti-Corruption Policy for further information. We also encourage you to seek guidance from your manager, the Human Resources Department, or Legal Department when you have any questions about whether a conflict of interest exists. If you are aware of an actual or potential conflict of interest (or concerned that a conflict may develop), please discuss the issue with either your manager, HR Business Partner, CHRO, or 2 the General Counsel. Corporate Opportunities As an employee of Xactly, you owe a duty to Xactly to advance its interests when you have the opportunity to do so. You should not (a) take business opportunities for yourself discovered through the use of Xactly property or information, or your position with Xactly; (b) use Xactly property or information, or your position with Xactly, for personal gain; or (c) compete with Xactly. Compliance with Laws and Policy Xactly strives to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. You must also comply with such laws and regulations when acting on behalf of Xactly. In addition to this Code of Conduct, you may be subject to additional policies, laws and regulations applicable to you based on your location and your position. If you have any questions regarding these requirements and your location/position, please contact HR Business Partner or the General Counsel. Business Relationships Business transactions with vendors, contractors, and other third parties shall be transacted free from offers or solicitation of gifts and favors or other improper inducements in exchange for influence or assistance in a transaction. You are prohibited from entering into side agreements with clients, vendors, contractors, etc. Business Inducements Xactly employees shall not seek to gain any advantage through the improper use of payments, business courtesies, gifts or other inducements. Offering, giving, soliciting, or receiving any form of bribe or other improper payment is prohibited. You may only provide gifts, entertainment, or other favors to third parties on behalf of Xactly if they are of nominal value. Gifts, entertainment, or other favors may never be provided to government officials on behalf of Xactly. Bribes and kickbacks  offering anything of value to obtain new business, retain existing business, expedite government actions, or secure any improper advantage  are strictly prohibited. You must fully comply with all anti-corruption laws of the countries in which we do business, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA) and the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010, which apply globally. For more information about the FCPA and the rules governing gifts to foreign officials, please refer to our Anti-Corruption Policy. Business Entertainment Business entertainment is any event, including dinners, luncheons, cocktail receptions, sporting or cultural events provided by an employee of Xactly to a business partner to further a business relationship in a social setting. Business partners may include current or prospective customers, partners, vendors, community and non-profit representatives, and industry peers. Business entertainment must comply with the following requirements. Business entertainment must be:  For a specific business purpose;  In good taste and not extravagant or excessive; and  Not intended to improperly influence business decisions. Business entertainment that does not meet the requirements referenced above will be considered a gift and subject to the requirements of Gift and Gratuities section of the Policy. 3 Business entertainment expenses must be appropriately classified on the expense report form in accordance with our Travel and Expense Policy. Tickets to Entertainment or Sporting Events From time to time Xactly receives tickets to entertainment or sporting events as a sponsor of the event or organization or as a result of an existing business relationship. Authorized managers or above may provide tickets to business partners if:  The tickets are not given for the purpose of securing preferential action, but rather are given as a courtesy received, or to build goodwill where the Xactly personnel offering the gift will attend the event;  Providing the tickets is not intended to improperly influence business decisions;  In good taste and not extravagant or excessive (<$300 per ticket); and  Public disclosure of the facts surrounding the entertainment would not embarrass Xactly. Receipt of Third-Party Gifts Generally, gifts of nominal value such as vendor trinkets for your desk are acceptable. Ordinary business entertainment and meals of reasonable value are acceptable. A raffle or door prize is acceptable. Gifts of cash are not acceptable. Receiving a gift or entertainment of nominal value (including, but not limited to, business dinners, beverages, recreation, and tickets) may be appropriate for a Xactly employee under certain limited circumstances where the gift or entertainment is:  For a specific business purpose;  Not exchanged frequently from the same source to the same recipient;  Not prohibited by either organizations policies;  A gift valued under $100 or entertainment or sporting event or activity valued at less than $300, where the person or Xactly offering the gift will be accompanying you to the event; and  Not intended to improperly influence business decisions. If you are unsure of how to handle a situation that you believe has the potential to violate this Code of Conduct, consult with your manager, CHRO or General Counsel. Government Officials Government employees may be subject to laws, regulations or policies regarding receipt of business entertainment. A Xactly employee shall not extend business entertainment to a government employee if the government employee advises that such business entertainment is prohibited or if the Xactly employee knows that such business entertainment is prohibited. Financial Integrity and Responsibility Financial integrity and fiscal responsibility of Xactlys resources are everyones personal responsibility. The money we spend for Xactly is not ours, it belongs to Xactly. Each person at Xactly  not just individuals in the Finance Department  has a role in making sure money is appropriately spent, our financial records are complete and accurate, and our internal controls are honored. Purchases must go through the Procurement Policy process or applicable processes for approval. Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, controller and persons performing similar functions are responsible for ensuring that disclosures in Xactlys reports to Xactlys board of 4 directors and other communications are full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable.

Confidentiality All non-public information of Xactly or its customers must remain confidential and must not be disclosed unless specifically authorized in writing by General Counsel or when disclosure is legally required in accordance with the confidentiality terms of your agreement with Xactly. If you are unsure whether information is non-public or if you are authorized to disclose the information, you should discuss the matter with General Counsel. Antitrust and Fair Dealing Competing vigorously, yet lawfully, with competitors and establishing advantageous, but fair, business relationships with customers and suppliers is a part of the foundation for long-term success. That being said, unlawful and unethical conduct, which may lead to short-term gains, would damage Xactlys reputation and long-term business prospects and may incur criminal or civil liability on Xactly. Accordingly, you must comply with antitrust and competition laws and deal ethically and lawfully with our customers, suppliers, competitors, employees, and contractors in all business dealings on our behalf. You should not take unfair advantage of another person or entity in business dealings on our behalf through the abuse of privileged or confidential information or through improper manipulation, concealment or misrepresentation of material facts or any other unfair dealing practices.

However, personnel will be subject to any applicable disclosure requirements under Xactly s Business Ethics and Conflict of Interest Policy.
